1️⃣ What is DBMS?
🔹 In-Depth Explanation

DBMS (Database Management System) is software that allows users to define, create, store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently in a database.

It acts as an interface between the user/application and the database, ensuring that data is:

Stored in a structured way

Secure from unauthorized access

Consistent and free from redundancy

Easily retrievable and updatable

Examples of DBMS include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

Without DBMS, data is stored in file systems, which leads to problems like data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of security, and difficult access.

🔹 Interview-Ready Answer

DBMS is software that manages databases and provides an efficient way to store, retrieve, update, and secure data while maintaining data consistency and integrity.

2️⃣ Why DBMS? (Need of DBMS)
🔹 In-Depth Explanation

DBMS is used to overcome the limitations of traditional file systems.

Problems in File System:

Data redundancy

Data inconsistency

No proper security

Difficult data access

No backup & recovery

No concurrency control

Advantages of DBMS:

Reduces data redundancy

Ensures data consistency

Provides data security

Supports multiple users simultaneously

Backup and recovery mechanisms

Maintains data integrity

Because of these benefits, DBMS is used in banking systems, college management systems, e-commerce platforms, etc.

🔹 Interview-Ready Answer

DBMS is used to reduce data redundancy, maintain consistency, provide security, support multi-user access, and offer backup and recovery features that are not possible in file systems.

3️⃣ Key Terminologies in DBMS
🔹 In-Depth Explanation
🔹 Database

A structured collection of related data stored electronically.

🔹 Table (Relation)

Data organized in rows and columns.

🔹 Tuple

A single row in a table representing one record.

🔹 Attribute

A column in a table representing a property of an entity.

🔹 Schema

Logical structure or blueprint of a database.

🔹 Instance

Actual data present in the database at a particular time.

🔹 Primary Key

A unique identifier for each record.

🔹 Foreign Key

A key that creates a relationship between two tables.

🔹 Interview-Ready Answer

Table: Collection of rows and columns

Tuple: A single row in a table

Attribute: A column in a table

Schema: Database structure

Instance: Data at a specific time

4️⃣ Keys in DBMS
🔹 In-Depth Explanation

Keys are attributes used to uniquely identify records and establish relationships between tables.

They help in:

Ensuring data uniqueness

Maintaining data integrity

Creating relationships

🔹 Types of Keys (In-Depth)
🔹 1. Super Key

A set of one or more attributes that uniquely identify a record.

🔹 2. Candidate Key

Minimal super key with no unnecessary attributes.

🔹 3. Primary Key

Chosen candidate key that uniquely identifies records and cannot be NULL.

🔹 4. Alternate Key

Candidate keys not selected as the primary key.

🔹 5. Foreign Key

Attribute in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.

🔹 6. Composite Key

Key formed using two or more attributes.

🔹 Interview-Ready Answers (VERY IMPORTANT ⭐)

Super Key: Any key that uniquely identifies a record

Candidate Key: Minimal super key

Primary Key: Selected candidate key that uniquely identifies records

Alternate Key: Candidate keys not chosen as primary key

Foreign Key: Key that links two tables

Composite Key: Key made of multiple attributes
