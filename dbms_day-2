🔷 What is an ER Diagram?
1️⃣ In-Depth Explanation

ER Diagram (Entity–Relationship Diagram) is a conceptual model used in DBMS to visually represent the structure of a database.

It shows:

Entities (objects)

Attributes (properties)

Relationships (connections between entities)

ER diagrams are mainly used in the database design phase, before converting the design into tables.

👉 It helps database designers understand:

What data needs to be stored

How data elements are related

How the database will be structured logically

🔷 Components of ER Diagram
🔹 1. Entity

An entity is a real-world object that has an independent existence.

📌 Examples:

Student

Employee

Customer

📐 Representation: Rectangle

🔹 2. Attribute

An attribute describes a property of an entity.

📌 Examples:

StudentID

Name

Age

📐 Representation: Oval

🔸 Types of Attributes:

Simple – cannot be divided (Age)

Composite – can be divided (Name → FirstName, LastName)

Single-valued – one value (DOB)

Multi-valued – multiple values (Phone Numbers)

Derived – calculated (Age from DOB)

🔹 3. Relationship

A relationship shows how two or more entities are connected.

📌 Example:

Student enrolls in Course

📐 Representation: Diamond

🔹 4. Cardinality

Cardinality defines how many entities are involved in a relationship.

Types:

One-to-One (1:1)

One-to-Many (1:N)

Many-to-Many (M:N)

📌 Example:

One student can enroll in many courses → 1:N

🔹 5. Primary Key

A primary key uniquely identifies an entity.

📌 Example:

StudentID

📐 Representation: Underlined attribute

🔷 Types of ER Diagrams

Conceptual ER Diagram – high-level design

Logical ER Diagram – includes attributes & keys

Physical ER Diagram – actual database structure

2️⃣ Interview-Ready Answer (Short & Crisp ⭐)

An ER diagram is a conceptual diagram used in DBMS to represent entities, attributes, and relationships among data. It is used during database design to visualize the structure of a database before implementation.

🔥 Very Common Interview Questions on ER Diagram
⭐ Q1. Why ER diagram is used?

Answer:
To design and visualize database structure clearly before implementation.

⭐ Q2. What are the main components of ER diagram?

Answer:
Entity, Attribute, Relationship.

⭐ Q3. How is an entity represented in ER diagram?

Answer:
By a rectangle.

⭐ Q4. What is cardinality?

Answer:
It defines the number of instances involved in a relationship.



🔷 Weak Entity & Identifying Relationship
1️⃣ Weak Entity
🔹 In-Depth Explanation

A weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes.

It depends on a strong entity for its existence

It does not have a primary key of its own

It uses a partial key (discriminator) along with the primary key of the strong entity

📌 Example:

Employee (strong entity)

Dependent (weak entity)

A dependent cannot exist without an employee.

🔹 Representation in ER Diagram

Weak Entity → Double Rectangle

Partial Key → Dashed Underline

2️⃣ Identifying Relationship
🔹 In-Depth Explanation

An identifying relationship is the relationship that connects a weak entity to its strong entity.

It helps uniquely identify weak entity records

Without this relationship, weak entity cannot exist

📌 Example:

Employee has Dependent

🔹 Representation in ER Diagram

Identifying Relationship → Double Diamond

🔥 Example (Employee – Dependent)

Employee (EmpID – Primary Key)

Dependent (DependentName – Partial Key)

Primary Key of Dependent = (EmpID + DependentName)

🔹 Interview-Ready Answer ⭐

A weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and depends on a strong entity for existence. An identifying relationship links the weak entity to its strong entity and helps in uniquely identifying its records.

🔥 ER Diagram VIVA QUESTIONS (MOST IMPORTANT)
⭐ BASIC LEVEL
1. What is an ER diagram?

Answer:
A conceptual diagram that represents entities, attributes, and relationships.

2. What is an entity?

Answer:
A real-world object with independent existence.

3. How is an entity represented?

Answer:
Using a rectangle.

4. What is an attribute?

Answer:
A property of an entity.

5. How is an attribute represented?

Answer:
Using an oval.

⭐ INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
6. What is a weak entity?

Answer:
An entity that depends on a strong entity and has no primary key.

7. What is a strong entity?

Answer:
An entity that has its own primary key.

8. What is a partial key?

Answer:
An attribute that partially identifies a weak entity.

9. How is a weak entity represented?

Answer:
Using a double rectangle.

10. What is an identifying relationship?

Answer:
A relationship that links a weak entity to its strong entity.

⭐ ADVANCED / TRICK QUESTIONS
11. Can a weak entity exist without a strong entity?

Answer:
No.

12. Can a weak entity have a primary key?

Answer:
No, it uses a partial key.

13. How is an identifying relationship shown?

Answer:
Using a double diamond.

14. Can a table have multiple weak entities?

Answer:
Yes, if they depend on the same strong entity.

15. Difference between weak entity and strong entity?
Strong Entity	Weak Entity
Has primary key	No primary key
Independent	Dependent
Single rectangle	Double rectangle
🔥 ONE-LINE RAPID FIRE (VERY COMMON)

Weak entity depends on → Strong entity

Weak entity key = Strong PK + Partial key

Weak entity symbol → Double rectangle

Identifying relationship symbol → Double diamond

Entity → Rectangle

Attribute → Oval

Relationship → Diamond

Primary Key → Underlined
