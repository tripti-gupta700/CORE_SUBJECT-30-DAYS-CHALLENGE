🔹 Polymorphism – Detailed Explanation

Polymorphism is an OOPS concept where one entity can have multiple forms.
The word polymorphism comes from:

Poly → many

Morphism → forms

In object-oriented programming, polymorphism allows the same method name to behave differently based on the object or the context in which it is used.

🔹 Real-Life Example of Polymorphism

A common real-life example is the word “drive”:

A person drives a car

A person drives a bike

A person drives a truck

The action is the same (drive), but the behavior is different depending on the vehicle.

Similarly, in programming, the same method can perform different actions depending on the object calling it.

🔹 Why Polymorphism Is Used

Polymorphism is used to:

Increase flexibility

Improve code reusability

Reduce complexity

Make code easier to extend and maintain

It allows us to write general code that works for different objects.

🔹 Types of Polymorphism
1️⃣ Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)

Compile-time polymorphism occurs when the method call is resolved at compile time.

This is achieved using method overloading.

Explanation:

Same method name

Different number or type of parameters

Real-Life Example:

A calculator can add two numbers or three numbers.
The operation is the same, but inputs differ.

2️⃣ Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

Run-time polymorphism occurs when the method call is resolved at runtime.

This is achieved using method overriding.

Explanation:

Same method name

Same parameters

Different implementation in child class

Real-Life Example:

A Shape class has a method draw().
A Circle draws differently than a Rectangle, even though both use draw().

🔹 Key Difference Between Compile-Time and Run-Time Polymorphism
Compile-Time	Run-Time
Method Overloading	Method Overriding
Resolved at compile time	Resolved at runtime
Faster	More flexible
No inheritance required	Inheritance required
🔹 One-Line Closing (Strong)

Polymorphism allows the same method to perform different actions based on the object, making the code flexible and extensible.

✅ VERSION 2: INTERVIEW-READY CRISP ANSWER (1–2 Minutes)
🔹 Polymorphism – Interview Answer

Polymorphism is an OOPS concept where one method or object can take multiple forms.
It allows the same method name to behave differently based on the object or situation.

🔹 Real-Life Example

A simple example is the word “drive.”
Driving a car and driving a bike use the same action but work differently.

🔹 Types of Polymorphism

There are two types of polymorphism:

Compile-time polymorphism, achieved using method overloading

Run-time polymorphism, achieved using method overriding

🔹 Java Perspective

In Java, compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, and run-time polymorphism is achieved through method overriding with inheritance.

🔹 One-Line Closing

Polymorphism makes code flexible, reusable, and easy to extend.
