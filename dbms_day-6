🔥 SQL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (INTERVIEW-READY)

🔹 1. SQL BASICS (MOST IMPORTANT)

⭐ What is SQL?

Answer:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage data in relational databases.

⭐ Is SQL case-sensitive?

Answer:
No, SQL keywords are not case-sensitive, but data stored in the database may be.

⭐ What are the types of SQL commands?

Answer:

DDL – CREATE, ALTER, DROP

DML – INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DQL – SELECT

DCL – GRANT, REVOKE

TCL – COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

⭐ Difference between DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE?
DELETE	TRUNCATE	DROP
Removes rows	Removes all rows	Removes table
WHERE allowed	WHERE not allowed	Structure deleted
Can rollback	Cannot rollback	Cannot rollback
🔹 2. SELECT QUERY & CLAUSES
⭐ What is SELECT?

Answer:
Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.

⭐ Difference between WHERE and HAVING?

Answer:

WHERE filters rows before grouping

HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY

⭐ What is ORDER BY?

Answer:
Used to sort results in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

⭐ What is GROUP BY?

Answer:
Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.

⭐ Can we use WHERE with GROUP BY?

Answer:
Yes, WHERE is used before grouping.

🔹 3. KEYS & CONSTRAINTS
⭐ What is a primary key?

Answer:
A unique identifier that cannot be NULL.

⭐ What is a foreign key?

Answer:
A key that references the primary key of another table.

⭐ Can a table have multiple primary keys?

Answer:
No, but it can have a composite primary key.

⭐ What are constraints in SQL?

Answer:
Rules to enforce data integrity.

Types:
PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT

🔹 4. JOINS (VERY VERY IMPORTANT)
⭐ What is a JOIN?

Answer:
Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

⭐ Types of JOINs?
JOIN	Meaning
INNER JOIN	Matching records
LEFT JOIN	All left + matched
RIGHT JOIN	All right + matched
FULL JOIN	All records
⭐ Difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?

Answer:
INNER JOIN returns only matching records, LEFT JOIN returns all left table records.

⭐ What is SELF JOIN?

Answer:
Joining a table with itself.

🔹 5. AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
⭐ What are aggregate functions?

Answer:
Functions that operate on multiple rows and return a single value.

Examples:
COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()

⭐ Difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column)?

Answer:

COUNT(*) → counts all rows

COUNT(column) → ignores NULL values

🔹 6. SUBQUERIES & NESTED QUERIES
⭐ What is a subquery?

Answer:
A query inside another query.

⭐ Types of subqueries?

Answer:

Single-row

Multi-row

Correlated subquery

⭐ Difference between IN and EXISTS?

Answer:

IN checks values

EXISTS checks existence of rows

🔹 7. VIEWS & INDEXES
⭐ What is a VIEW?

Answer:
A virtual table created using a SELECT query.

⭐ Why use views?

Answer:

Security

Simplifies complex queries

Data abstraction

⭐ What is an INDEX?

Answer:
A database object that improves query performance.

⭐ Does index increase INSERT time?

Answer:
Yes, because index must be updated.

🔹 8. NULL & FUNCTIONS
⭐ What is NULL?

Answer:
Represents missing or unknown data.

⭐ Difference between NULL and 0?

Answer:
NULL means no value, 0 is a value.

⭐ How to handle NULL values?

Answer:
Using functions like IFNULL(), COALESCE().

🔹 9. TRANSACTIONS (FRESHER FAVORITE)
⭐ What is a transaction?

Answer:
A set of operations executed as a single unit.

⭐ What is ACID?

Answer:

Atomicity – All or nothing

Consistency – Valid state

Isolation – Independent transactions

Durability – Permanent changes

⭐ Difference between COMMIT and ROLLBACK?

Answer:
COMMIT saves changes, ROLLBACK undoes changes.

🔹 10. SQL VS DBMS (COMMON HR QUESTION)
⭐ Difference between SQL and MySQL?

Answer:

SQL → language

MySQL → database software

🔥 RAPID FIRE (VERY COMMON)

Which clause is executed first in SQL? → FROM

Can WHERE use aggregate functions? → No

Can HAVING be used without GROUP BY? → Yes

Which join returns unmatched rows? → LEFT/RIGHT JOIN

Which constraint prevents duplicate values? → UNIQUE

🔥 MOST ASKED PRACTICAL QUESTIONS

Find second highest salary

Count employees per department

Fetch duplicate records

Find employees without manager

Get max salary from each department

(If you want, I’ll give queries + logic)

🎯 INTERVIEW STRATEGY (IMPORTANT)

For freshers:

Speak clear logic, not heavy syntax

Use keywords: data integrity, performance, optimization

Don’t panic if you forget exact query — explain approach
