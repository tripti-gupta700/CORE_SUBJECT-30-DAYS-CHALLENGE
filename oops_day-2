🔹 Encapsulation – Interview Ready Script

Encapsulation is an OOPS concept where data and the methods that operate on that data are wrapped into a single unit, and direct access to the data is restricted.

In simple words, encapsulation means data hiding with controlled access.

A real-life example is an ATM machine.
When we use an ATM, we can withdraw money or check balance, but we cannot directly access or modify the bank’s database.
The internal data is hidden, and we interact with it only through allowed operations.

Similarly, in programming, we keep variables private and allow access through public methods.
This protects data from misuse and improves security and maintainability.

🔹 Why Encapsulation is Used – Script

Encapsulation is used to protect data, prevent unauthorized access, and make the code easier to maintain.
It also allows us to change the internal implementation without affecting other parts of the program.

🔹 Access Modifiers – Interview Ready Script

Access modifiers are used to define the visibility or accessibility of classes, variables, and methods in a program.
They help us control how data is accessed and are an important part of encapsulation.

🔹 Types of Access Modifiers – Script with Real Life Examples
🔒 Private

Private members are accessible only within the same class.
A real-life example is an ATM PIN, which only the account holder and bank system can access.

🏠 Default

Default access allows access only within the same package.
It is like internal office information used only by people in the same department.

🛡️ Protected

Protected members are accessible within the same package and also by subclasses.
A real-life example is family property, which is shared with children but not outsiders.

🌍 Public

Public members can be accessed from anywhere.
For example, a public website that anyone can visit.

🔹 Encapsulation + Access Modifiers – Final Script

Encapsulation is implemented using access modifiers.
We usually make data members private and provide public methods to access them in a controlled manner.
This ensures security, data integrity, and clean code design.

🔥 One-Line Closing (Very Impressive)

Encapsulation hides the data, and access modifiers decide who can access it.
