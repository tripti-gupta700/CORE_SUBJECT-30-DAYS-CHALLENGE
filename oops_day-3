✅ VERSION 1: IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION (Detailed & Clear)
🔹 Inheritance – Detailed Explanation

Inheritance is an important concept of Object-Oriented Programming where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.
It helps in reusing existing code and extending it to create new functionality.

The class whose properties are inherited is called the parent or base class, and the class that inherits those properties is called the child or derived class.

Inheritance creates a parent–child relationship between classes, making the program more organized and structured.

🔹 Real-Life Example of Inheritance

A common real-life example is a parent and child relationship.
A child inherits qualities like surname or property from the parent but also has their own individual characteristics.

Similarly, in programming, a child class can use the common properties of a parent class and can also add new features specific to itself.

🔹 Why Inheritance Is Used

Inheritance is mainly used to:

Achieve code reusability

Reduce code duplication

Improve maintainability

Represent real-world hierarchical relationships

It is especially useful in large applications where many classes share common behavior.

🔹 Types of Inheritance
1️⃣ Single Inheritance

In single inheritance, one child class inherits from one parent class.

Example:
A Student class inherits from a Person class, gaining common attributes like name and age.

2️⃣ Multiple Inheritance

In multiple inheritance, one child class inherits from more than one parent class.

Example:
A Smartphone inherits features of both a Camera and a Phone.

📌 Java Note:
Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes because it can create ambiguity, but it supports it using interfaces.

3️⃣ Multilevel Inheritance

In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.

Example:
Grandparent → Parent → Child

Each level inherits features from the previous level.

4️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

Example:
A system that uses both single and multiple inheritance together.

📌 In Java, hybrid inheritance is implemented using interfaces, not classes.

🔹 Diamond Problem – Detailed Explanation

The Diamond Problem occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that have a common parent class.

Real-Life Explanation

Consider a Person class.
Two classes, Teacher and Athlete, inherit from Person.
Now, a Student class inherits from both Teacher and Athlete.

If Person has a method like getRole(), the compiler cannot decide which inherited method should be used.
This confusion is called the Diamond Problem.

🔹 Why Diamond Problem Occurs

It occurs due to multiple inheritance paths leading to the same parent class, causing ambiguity in method resolution.

🔹 How Java Solves the Diamond Problem

Java avoids this issue by:

Not allowing multiple inheritance with classes

Allowing multiple inheritance only through interfaces, where ambiguity is resolved by explicit method implementation

🔹 Closing Statement

Inheritance improves code reusability and structure, but unrestricted multiple inheritance can cause ambiguity, which is why Java handles it carefully.

✅ VERSION 2: INTERVIEW-READY CRISP ANSWER (1–2 Minutes)
🔹 Inheritance – Interview Answer

Inheritance is an OOPS concept where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.
It helps in code reusability and building new functionality on top of existing code.

The class that provides data is called the parent class, and the class that inherits it is called the child class.

🔹 Real-Life Example

A parent and child relationship is a simple example.
A child inherits properties from the parent and can also have its own features.

🔹 Why Inheritance Is Used

Inheritance is used to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and represent hierarchical relationships between classes.

🔹 Types of Inheritance

There are four main types of inheritance:

Single: one child, one parent

Multiple: one child, multiple parents

Multilevel: inheritance in a chain

Hybrid: combination of multiple types

Java supports multiple and hybrid inheritance using interfaces, not classes.

🔹 Diamond Problem

The Diamond Problem occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that share a common parent, causing ambiguity in method resolution.

Java avoids this problem by not supporting multiple inheritance with classes and using interfaces instead.

🔹 One-Line Closing

Inheritance promotes reusability, but Java restricts multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity.
