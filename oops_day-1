1️⃣ What is OOPS? (Object-Oriented Programming System)

Interview Answer:

OOPS is a programming approach where we write code by thinking in terms of real-world objects instead of only functions and logic.

Each object has properties (data) and behaviors (methods), just like things around us in real life.

Real-life example:

Think of a mobile phone.

Properties: brand, color, battery

Behaviors: call(), message(), charge()

In OOPS, we design software in the same way—by modeling real-world things as objects.

One-line backup (if interviewer pushes):

OOPS helps us structure code in a way that matches how humans naturally think about the world.

2️⃣ Why do we use OOPS?

Interview Answer:

We use OOPS to make code easy to understand, reusable, scalable, and maintainable.

Explain with a real-life situation:

Imagine building a college management system.
Instead of writing everything again and again, we create:

Student

Teacher

Course

Each has its own data and actions.
If something changes, we update it in one place, not everywhere.

Key benefits (say calmly):

Code is organized

Easy to reuse

Easy to modify

Suitable for large applications

Short punchline:

OOPS saves time, reduces errors, and makes large projects manageable.

3️⃣ What is a Class?

Interview Answer:

A class is a blueprint or template that defines what an object will look like and what it can do.

Real-life example (very effective):

A class is like a blueprint of a house.
The blueprint decides:

number of rooms

design

structure

But the blueprint itself is not the house.

Programming connection:

Similarly, a class defines variables and methods, but no memory is used until an object is created.

4️⃣ What is an Object?

Interview Answer:

An object is a real instance of a class.
It represents an actual thing that exists and can be used.

Real-life example (continue house example):

If class is the blueprint,
then the actual house built using that blueprint is the object.

Another quick example (very relatable):

Class: Student

Object:

Name: Tripti

Roll No: 21

Branch: CSE

Each student is an object of the Student class.

5️⃣ Ultra-short summary (great for confidence)

If they ask you to summarize:

OOPS is about designing programs using real-world objects.
A class is a blueprint, and an object is the real thing created from that blueprint.
We use OOPS to write clean, reusable, and maintainable code.
